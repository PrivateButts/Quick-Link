#  ![Logo](./img/icon.png) Quick Link

This extension quickly puts the HTML cruft around selected text to make it a link. Nothing fancy, but it should make working with HTML files a little less painful.

## Features

Currently this extension supports the following replacements:
* Mail To
* Telecom related protocols
    * Tel
